# LogicGates_usingNN
I have demonstrated the implementation of Neural Networks to simulate Logic gates such as AND, NAND, and XOR. Additionally, I have illustrated the effect of changing hyperparameters on the behavior of the networks.

In the word documnet attached, I have shown the following points:

1) Change no. of hidden layers
2) Execute this for fewer epochs and learn the behavior.
3) Compute error for different learning rate, epochs, and hidden layers
4) Repeat for NAND gate and XOR gates
