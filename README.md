# LogicGates_usingNN
Implementing Logic gates (AND, NAND, XOR) using Neural Networks. I have also shown changes to hyperparameters and then shown how the networks behaviour changes.

In the word documnet attached, I have shown the following points in detail:

1) Change no. of hidden layers
2) Execute this for fewer epochs and learn the behavior.
3) Compute error for different learning rate, epochs, and hidden layers
4) Repeat for NAND gate and XOR gates
